# Freenome Coding Challenge
**Vy Thai**

A command-line version of a single game of Blackjack. The only two players are the Player(user) and 
Dealer. The Player will be prompted to interact with the command-line throughout the game, and all dealing,
drawing, and other game play will be handled automatically by the program.

**Gameplay Overview**
1. Deal initial cards (two cards to each player)
2. Display initial hands (hiding dealer's second card and score)
3. Prompt user (Hit or Stand?)
    * Hit: add card to hand (check if busted)
    * Stand: end turn
    * show updated hand and value
    * repeat until player has stood, won (score == 21), or busted (score > 21)
4. Dealer plays (if player has neither busted nor won)
    * print dealer's full hand, score
    * dealer keeps hitting until score >= 17
5. Decide and report the winner, including hands and scores where relevant
